**Problem ID: 005 - File Upload Management System**

### Problem Description:
Create a backend application where users can upload files to a specific folder. The uploaded file name, size, and upload date must be stored in the database.

### Work:
1. **Creating File Upload System**:
 - The user will upload a file, and the file will be saved in the specified folder on the server.
 - The file name, size, and upload date must be stored in the database during upload.

2. **Changing File Name**:
 - The file name will be changed automatically if there are files with the same name during file upload.

### Input:
- a file (any type)

### Output:
- If successfully uploaded, the file name, size, and upload date will be stored in the database and displayed in the response.

### Example:
**File Upload:**

````
POST /upload
File: example.jpg
````

**Output:**
```json
{
 "status": "success",
 "message": "File uploaded successfully",
 "data": {
 "file_name": "example_1.jpg",
 "size": "1.2MB",
 "uploaded_at": "2024-09-24"
 }
}
````

### Instructions:
- Database connection must be created using PDO.
- PHP's `move_uploaded_file()` function should be used for file upload.
- File size and name to be stored in database.
