**Problem ID: 003 - Content Management System (CMS) Basic CRUD**

**Problem:**

For a content management system (CMS), you need to create a simple article management application, where you can add, edit, delete, and view articles. You need to create four API endpoints, which are as follows:

1. **GET /articles**
 - Show all articles in a list form.

2. **POST /articles**
 - Will input data to add a new article. Input will be `title`, `content`.

3. **PUT /articles/{id}**
 - Will take input to update an article according to specified id. Input will be `title`, `content`.

4. **DELETE /articles/{id}**
 - Will delete articles according to specified id.

**Instructions:**
- Create a MySQL database to store the articles. The table can be named `articles` and contain the fields `id`, `title`, `content`, and `created_at` (where `created_at` stores the time).
- Connect to database using PDO.
- Write appropriate logic for each endpoint.

**API Call Example:**

- **GET /articles:**
 If you call the `GET /articles` endpoint in Postman, it will return all articles in JSON format.

- **POST /articles:**
 When calling `POST /articles` in Postman, input JSON as the body:
 ```json
 {
 "title": "My First Article",
 "content": "This is the content of the article."
 }
 ````

- **PUT /articles/1:**
 When calling `PUT /articles/1` in Postman, input JSON as body:
 ```json
 {
 "title": "Updated Title",
 "content": "Updated content of the article."
 }
 ````

- **DELETE /articles/1:**
 Calling `DELETE /articles/1` in Postman will delete the article with id 1.
