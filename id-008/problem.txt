**Problem ID: 008**
**Subject: OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**

### Problem Description:
You need to create a class named **"BankAccount"**. A customer can manage his bank account through this class. The class should contain the following features:

1. **Properties (Attribute/Variables)**:
 - `accountNumber` (bank account number)
 - `accountHolder` (name of account holder)
 - `balance` (current balance of the account)

2. **Methods (Functions)**:
 - `deposit(amount)` - This method will deposit a specified amount of money into the account.
 - `withdraw(amount)` - This method will withdraw a specified amount from the account. But if the account balance is not sufficient, the withdrawal will not be possible and appropriate message will be displayed.
 - `checkBalance()` - This method will show the current balance of the account.

### Input and Output:
1. Initially the account balance will be 0.
2. Money can be deposited using `deposit(amount)` method.
3. Withdraw(amount) method.
4. Balance can be checked with `checkBalance()` method.

### Example:
```php
$account = new BankAccount("123456", "John Doe");

// Depositing money
$account->deposit(5000);

// Attempt to withdraw money
$account->withdraw(2000);

// Checking the balance
echo $account->checkBalance(); // Output: 3000
````

### Challenge:
- Data security must be maintained within the class (Encapsulation).
- Account balance cannot be negative.
