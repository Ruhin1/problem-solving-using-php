Problem ID: 011 - Advanced PHP OOP: Classes, Objects, and Access Modifiers

**Problem Description:**
A restaurant management system needs to be developed, where there will be different types of employees (eg managers, waiters). Each employee will have a name, designation, and salary.

Here are some conditions to follow:
1. Create an `Employee` class for each employee.
2. Keep `name`, `designation`, and `salary` as `private` properties inside the class.
3. Create a constructor, which will set `name`, `designation`, and `salary`.
4. Create a public method `getDetails()`, which will return all the employee data.
5. Create a method `updateSalary()`, which will update the salary.
6. Create a subclass named `Manager`, which inherits from the `Employee` class and has an additional method `assignTask()`.

**Your task:**
1. Create `Employee` and `Manager` classes.
2. Use constructors and necessary access modifiers for classes.
3. Add additional methods to the `Manager` class.
4. Create multiple `Employee` and `Manager` objects, expose their data and methods.

**Input example:**
```php
$employee1 = new Employee("Rahim", "Waiter", 15000);
$manager1 = new Manager("Karim", "Manager", 30000);

$employee1->updateSalary(17000);
$manager1->assignTask("Prepare report for this month.");
```

**Example output:**
```
Employee: Rahim, Designation: Waiter, Salary: 17000
Manager: Karim, Designation: Manager, Salary: 30000
Assigned Task: Prepare report for this month.
```

Solving this problem will give you a deeper understanding of PHP classes, objects, access modifiers, and inheritance.
