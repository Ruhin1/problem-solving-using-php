**Issue 2 (ID: WD-201): User Registration API**

### Problem Description:
You need to create a simple REST API using PHP, which accepts username, email and password, and stores it in the database.

### What to do:
1. Create a ``users'' table in the MySQL database, containing the following fields:
 - `id` (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY)
 - `name` (VARCHAR(100))
 - `email` (VARCHAR(100), UNIQUE)
 - `password` (VARCHAR(255))

2. Create a PHP script that will accept `POST` requests:
 - will take `name`, `email`, and `password` as input.
 - Validate data (emails are not duplicates, passwords are at least 6 characters long, etc.).
 - Hash the password with the `password_hash()` function.
 - will store the user in the database.
 - will output the JSON:
 - if successful: `{ "status": "success", "message": "User registered successfully" }`
 - on failure: `{ "status": "error", "message": "User already exists" }`

### Submission Rules:
When solving the problem, mention the problem ID `WD-201` with the solution.
