### Problem ID: 012 - Object-Oriented E-Commerce System

**Problem Description:**

A simple e-commerce system needs to be developed, where various products can be added, deleted and product prices can be updated. It uses some important object-oriented concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, abstractions, interfaces and traits. Follow the steps below:

1. **Product Class:**
 - Create a `Product` class, which contains the product name, type, price, and stock.
 - Product name, type and price must be set via constructor.
 - There should be a method to update product price and stock.

2. **Discount Interface:**
 - Create a ``Discount'' interface that will contain the ``applyDiscount()'' method.
 - Discount should be applied according to the price of the product.

3. **DigitalProduct and PhysicalProduct Class:**
 - Create two classes named `DigitalProduct` and `PhysicalProduct`, which inherit from the `Product` class.
 - `DigitalProduct` and `PhysicalProduct` will follow different discount method.

4. **ProductManager Class:**
 - Create a `ProductManager` class, where products can be added, removed and list of products can be displayed.

5. **Trait Usage:**
 - A `Logger` trait must be created, where each product manipulation (eg adding, removing) will be logged.

**Instructions:**
- Solve problems using classes and interfaces.
- Create logical test cases to verify that each function is working correctly.

**Example output:**
```php
$product1 = new PhysicalProduct("Laptop", "Electronics", 50000);
$product2 = new DigitalProduct("E-Book", "Books", 150);

$productManager = new ProductManager();
$productManager->addProduct($product1);
$productManager->addProduct($product2);

// Apply discount and update stock
$product1->applyDiscount(10); // Physical Product gets 10% discount
$product2->applyDiscount(5); // Digital Product gets 5% discount

$productManager->showAllProducts();
````

**Which Will Learn:**
- How to create classes and objects.
- Use of Inheritance, Abstraction, and Interfaces.
- Trait and its real life application.
